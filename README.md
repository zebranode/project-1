## Features & Technologies 
**Bootstrap**  
Used [throughout](https://onecheesepizza.github.io/project-1/index.html) for layout, default styles, mobile responsiveness, and being accessibility friendly.  

**ARIA Atributes**  
Used [throughout](https://onecheesepizza.github.io/project-1/index.html) to ensure screen-reader compatibility, per the client's requirements.

**Google Maps API**  
Used on the [locations page](https://onecheesepizza.github.io/project-1/locations.html) to dynamically load a new map based on the selected location  .

**Imgur API**  
Used on the [menu page](https://onecheesepizza.github.io/project-1/menu.html) to load images using AJAX hosted on [Imgur.com](https://imgur.com/). This implementation allows the business owner to update the product images on their own without developer intervention.  

**Parsley.js**  
Used on the [contact page](https://onecheesepizza.github.io/project-1/contact.html) to validate the form's inputs, chosen for its simple implementation and being accessibility friendly.  

**Formspree API**  
Used on the [contact page](https://onecheesepizza.github.io/project-1/contact.html) to perform the form action using their API instead of using our own server-side script.
