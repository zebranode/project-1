                <p class="about-paragraph">It would not be an exaggeration to say that restauranteur Sami Othman was raised in a deli.
                    From the age of ten, he worked at his father’s side at the family-owned deli in New York. A quick leaner and an
                    extremely hard worker, he saved enough to open his own deli in 1977 at the age of 16. He acquired the property for
                    his deli from his father. The property had previously been a real estate office that his father had shuttered. Sami
                    named his first restaurant Aziz O Deli, after his father.</p>
                <p class="about-paragraph">He proved to be a natural in the restaurant business. Six months later Sami was able to open
                    several additional delis throughout Long Island, New York. His life changed on a trip to California in 1982. He fell
                    in love with the promise of Los Angeles and decided to sell all of his delis in New York, except for two that he
                    gave to his brothers. Sami and his wife, Maria, packed up their young family and drove cross country to California.
                    He opened his first California deli in Pasadena. Other delis soon followed, including one in South Central Los
                    Angeles.</p>
                <p class="about-paragraph">Since opening his deli in New York as a teenager, Sami had always dreamed of combining a New
                    York style deli with a New Orleans restaurant. He believed that the best Hero sandwiches are from NYC and that the
                    best Po’ Boys sandwiches were in New Orleans. In 2013, his dream finally became a reality. In less than 2 years,
                    Samiand his family opened three Orleans & York Delis in Inglewood, Baldwin Hills and Downtown Los Angeles. They have
                    three additional locations that will soon be opening in Carson, Orange County and the Mid-Wilshire area of Los
                    Angeles, in addition to expanding nationwide.</p>
                <p class="about-paragraph">In 2015, Orleans & York Deli was named the #1 Cajun & Creole Restaurant in Los Angeles by
                    Trip Advisor, and its Po Boy Sandwiches were named the best in Los Angeles by LA Magazine. Now that his children
                    have grown up and assumed important roles in the family business, Sami has several delicious and exciting concepts
                    that he intends to introduce to the LA food scene.</p>
